  add any addenda you will want to set this in a code block somewhere that takes

    How do I pick a court?
  content: |
    If you are responding to a case someone else filed, you may not
    get to choose your court. Select the court that is already
    listed on your court paperwork. 
    
    But if you are starting a new case, you have
    a choice. How do you know which court to choose?
  
    Massachusetts has 5 trial court departments that hear family law cases:
    
    * District Court
    * Boston Municipal Court (BMC)
    * Superior Court
    * Probate and Family Court
    * Juvenile Court
    
    The District Court, BMC, and Superior Court are all courts that can hear
    any type of case. Probate and Family and Juvenile Court are
    both **specialist** courts that hear one kind of case.
    They have judges with special training as well as special 
    resources available.
    
    Different courts can make different kinds of decisions. Not every court
    can give you every kind of help. For example, you can only
    ask for visitation in the Probate and Family Court.
    
    Depending on where you live, different courts may be further or closer to
    your address. There are about 100 district courts all over the state,
    but each county has only one or a few Superior Courts or specialty
    courts.
    
    Choosing a court means thinking about what kind of help you need, as well
    as which court you can get transportation to on the day of your hearing.
    
    Only you know the right choice.
    
    You can also view the court selection guidance at [mass.gov](https://www.mass.gov/courthouse-locator).
